# 🛰️ Unified Public Wi-Fi Security Monitoring System for Smart Cities

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains research and resources for the project **"Unified Public Wi-Fi Security Monitoring System for Smart Cities"**, developed under the **Department of AIT, Chandigarh University**.  
The project proposes an **Integrated Cybersecurity Framework (ICF)** that unifies security monitoring across all public Wi-Fi access points in a smart city environment.

## 🧠 Objective
The main objective of this project is to **improve the security and reliability of public Wi-Fi networks** in smart cities through:
- Centralized data aggregation
- Real-time intrusion detection and response
- Machine Learning–based anomaly detection
- Integration with municipal infrastructure (CCTV, traffic systems, IoT)

## ⚙️ Methodology
The framework follows a **four-layered approach**:
1. **Unified Data Ingestion** – Collection of Wi-Fi network logs and telemetry.
2. **Hybrid Analysis Engine** – Combines signature-based IDS and ML-based anomaly detection.
3. **Automated Orchestration (SOAR)** – Enables automatic mitigation and alerts.
4. **Centralized Visualization** – Unified security dashboard for real-time monitoring.

## 🧩 System Architecture
- **Edge Layer:** Public Wi-Fi Access Points act as security sensors.  
- **Aggregation Layer:** Regional collectors normalize and forward data.  
- **Core Processing Layer:** Hosts data lake, ML models, and incident response systems.  
- **Interface Layer:** Central dashboard and APIs for integration with city systems.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Snort IDS  
- Wireshark  
- Machine Learning (Anomaly Detection)  
- SOAR Frameworks  
- Dashboard & APIs (Flask / Django / Node.js)

## 🏙️ Smart City Integration
The system can detect and prevent attacks that threaten:
- Public safety networks  
- Traffic management systems  
- Smart utility services  
- IoT-enabled devices across the city  

## 🚀 Expected Outcomes
- Enhanced threat detection and real-time response  
- Unified and scalable Wi-Fi security monitoring  
- Reduced attack dwell time through automated mitigation  
- Insights into network usage and behavior  

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Expansion to 5G/LoRaWAN IoT networks  
- Predictive AI for proactive threat prevention  
- Blockchain-based authentication  
- Federated learning for privacy-preserving AI models
